
# Phase 3 Code Challenge - Restaurants

This project implements a restaurant review domain with Customer, Restaurant, and Review classes.

## Files

- `customers.py` - Contains the Customer class
- `restaurants.py` - Contains the Restaurant class  
- `reviews.py` - Contains the Review class 
- `app.py` - Main file to run the code

## Running the Code

To test the code:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/abvss13/Phase-3-Code-Challenge-Restaurants.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory: 

```
cd Phase-3-Code-Challenge-Restaurants
```

3. Run app.py:

```
python app.py  
```

This will import all classes and print out customer and restaurant instances as a test.

You can also run the individual files, for example:

```
python customers.py
```

This will test just the Customer class functionality.  

## Code Overview

- `Customer` initializes customer instances with first and last names
- `Restaurant` initializes restaurants with a name 
- Methods like `name()`, `given_name()` are used to return values
- `Review` connects customers and restaurants, but is still a work in progress
- `app.py` imports and links everything together for testing
